IDE -> Integrated Development Environment -> Used to write, debug and execute code

Class -> Blueprint / template having common features of similar objects

Object -> instance of a class

Action / Behaviuor -> Method -> used to create reusable code

Data / Information -> Variables

Class -> Contains variables and methods

workspace -> folder, Used to keep the project codes
Project -> All the programs related to particular application /project will be saved under a 
particular folder

package -> folder to have all the java programs / class

To save all the java programs:
src/main/java -> Development code
src/test/java -> Test code

Other than java files : eg xlsx, txt, json, properties, config
src/main/resources
src/test/resources


package name -> should be starting with lowercase; should be an alphabet



ClassName (Pascal Notation)-> Starts with uppercase; When we have multiple words, each word should start with upper case


methodName(camelCase) -> Starts with lower; when we have multiple words, from the second words onwards start with upper case

Shortcuts:
type methodName -> cntrl+spacebar; tap enter key
type syso -> cntrl+spacebar
type main -> cntrl+spacebar; tap enter key

main():
To execute a java program -> main method is mandatory
Java execution starts from the main method


objectName -> camelCase naming standard


Variable -> Is a container to store data / information

Two Types of Variables:
------------------------
1. Global Variables -> Declared inside class and out of all methods. Can be used by all the methods
2. Local Variables -> Declared within a method


800000 -> number
brandName -> Hyundai
fuelCapacity -> 25.5

Primitive Datatypes
-------------------
byte -> 1 byte -> 8 bits
short -> 2 bytes
int -> 4 bytes
long -> 8 bytes

float -> 4 bytes
double -> 8 bytes


Non-Primitive Datatypes
------------------------
String -> used to store sequence of character
