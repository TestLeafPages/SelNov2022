Cucumber - BDD (Behavioural Driven Development):
JBehave
SpecFlow


Test Driven Development:
	- Write the testcases first
	- Get the approval for the testcases
	- Development should be based on the testcases
	
Cons:
	- Lot of negative testcases were covered rather than positive testcases
	
Acceptance Test Driven Development:
	- Write the acceptance testcases first
	- Develop the software based on the acceptance testcases
	
Cons:
	- Communication gap between the technical and non-technical team
	
Behavioural Driven Development:
	- To address the communication gap between tech and non-technical teams
	- Write the acceptance testcases first using common language
		(understandable to both tech and non-technical teams)
		
Gherin Keywords:

Feature - Describes the functionality of an application
Scenario - Describes a behaviour/ testcase
Given - Represent a pre-condition
When - Represent Test Condition/ Step
Then - Represent the expected Result (for positive scenario)
But - Represent the expected Result (for negative scenario)
And - link two other test steps

3 Layers:
	- Features			- File to write the BDD testcases
	- Step Defintions	- Implement the test steps using Java/ Selenium
	- Runner			- TestNG for execution
